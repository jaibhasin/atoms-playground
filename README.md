# Atoms & Molecules

Immersive web experience that lets visitors explore the internal structure of atoms. The initial milestone focuses on a scientifically grounded Iron (Fe) atom rendered in 3D with React Three Fiber.

## Tech stack
- **Frontend:** Vite + React + TypeScript
- **3D layer:** three.js with @react-three/fiber and @react-three/drei helpers
- **State & controls:** Zustand, Leva (planned)

## Development
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Roadmap
1. Experiential landing section with cosmic UI treatment.
2. Accurate Fe atom visualization (nucleus, proton/neutron clusters, electron shells with orbital velocities).
3. Interactions such as light excitation to move electrons between shells.
4. Backend/API for atom metadata and future user experiments.
